Contributions:


Swapnil Mukeshbhai Chadotra


* Studied and analyzed the syntax and design of similar imperative languages and determined the best practices used in terms of syntax
* Created grammar for introductory features of the language


Jay Yogeshbhai Patel


* Analyzed various tools for performing lexical analysis and parsing


Manan Hasmukhkumar Patel


* Performed Research on techniques and tools used for semantic evaluation and interpretation/execution of the program code.


Jashmin Mineshkumar Patel


* Determined the best grammar and BNF notations and studied techniques used by modern programming languages for performing lexical analysis


Sudheer Reddy Kunduru


* Finalized the semantics of the language
* Worked on complex features of the grammar including control structures and typing




Implementation Plan:


Week 1: 


* Implementation of Lexical Analyzer using python
* Design and Implementation of Definite Clause Grammar using prolog


Week 2: 


* Refining and finalizing the parse tree generation
* Coding the semantic evaluator using prolog
* Implementation of the interpreter
* Testing the lexical analyzer, parser and evaluator with full programs
* Handling errors within user programs
